## 🛰️ Overview

LF-GNSS is an open-sourced deep learning and Kalman filter integrated framework for satellite positioning. The released implementation is fully developed in Python and built upon PyTorch, supporting both model training and inference. It provides a flexible research foundation for integrating AI and GNSS technologies, and we hope it will serve as a baseline for future studies at the intersection of satellite navigation and artificial intelligence, encouraging researchers and developers to extend, refine, and build upon this work.
